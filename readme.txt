= What is personalization and why is it important? =
Every visitor on an online store is different. They have different preferences, tastes and different likes and dislikes. Then it doesn't make sense to show all of them the same products. Showcasing the most relevant products right on the landing page is the surest way of getting the customers hooked and keep coming back for more.
This is exactly where personalization comes in. TargetingMantra product personalization helps e-commerce companies showcase only the most relevant products to users based on their behavior and interests. The deals, best sellers, new-arrivals, similar products all change dynamically as per the taste of the consumer.

Showing relevant products, deals, banners, promotions to customers will help your store increase its conversion (20%-25%) and hence increase your revenue. Our suite has over 17 widgets for all your Business needs. Widgets include:
* People who viewed also viewed
* People who bought also bought
* Recent history
* Recommendations based on recent history
* Brand similarities
* Frequently bought together
